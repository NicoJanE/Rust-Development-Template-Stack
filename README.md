> ### Preview the markdown files(.md)
>
>To preview the Markdown (MD) files in this project, one of the best solutions is to open these files in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and install the plugin: **Markdown Preview GitHub Styling** (Tested with version 2.04). Other plugins, or plugins for other programs, may not always work correctly with the file links in the documentation. I use the file link syntax supported by GitHub (Jekyll), which is also compatible with the above-mentioned plugin.
